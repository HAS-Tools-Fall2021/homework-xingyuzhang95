Use this folder to submit your cheat sheets for grading

#Grades:
1. GitHub: 5/10  Good start but it seems like what you submitted is your notes on the class overall so far. I'm just looking for a cheat sheet that covers the GitHub questions. Also there were two submissions in here so I'm not sure which one is the one for grading.

Refer to the GitHub Cheat Sheet assignment instructions on the Week3 assignment it has a list of questions that should be covered.

Also good start on the markdown but your formatting is not working. Refer back to the markdown cheat sheet and make sure you preview your markdown file before you submit to see that your formatting is actually working. For example you need a space after the '#' for the headings to work.
