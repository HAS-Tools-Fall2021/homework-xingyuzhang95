==========================================================================================
Three criteria were used to select flow values for week 1 and week 2 forecast. September, day 12-18 (19-25) for week 1 (2), and flow of less than 200 cfs. The idea behind those criteria is to construct a flow climatology at the same time. Moreover, I used flow of 200 cfs as an extra standard because flows in previous two weeks are less than 200 cfs and less precipitation forecasted for week 1 and 2.

Questions
Describe the variables flow, year, month, and day. What type of objects are they? What data types are they composed of? How long are they?

flow, year, month, and day are lists. Flow is composed by float numbers, while others are compsed by integer. They have the same length of 11942.

How many times was the daily flow greater than your prediction in the month of September (express your answer in terms of the total number of times and as a percentage)?

534; 54.99%

How would your answer to the previous question change if you considered only daily flows in or before 2000? Same question for the flows in or after the year 2010? (again report total number of times and percentage)

before 2000: 262; 79.39%

after 2010: 160; 25.4%

How does the daily flow generally change from the first half of September to the second?

The average daily flows of first and second half of September are 178.1 cfs and 166.4 cfs, respectively, indicating that the daily flow generally is decreasing from the first half of September to the second one.
