### Summary and supporting plots
Given September flow values and October flow distribtuion, I predicted flows during next week and two weeks later are 80 cfs and 80 cfs, respectively.

1. Time series plot of observed daily flow during 1989-2021. The time series is stationary.

2. Boxplot of daily observed flow before and after 2014: we see the distribution of October flow changes during these two periods. The time series is stationary with 12 month peried change

5. The comparison of 2019 and 2020 October flow, which suggests October flow has no severe climate in both 2019 and 2020.
