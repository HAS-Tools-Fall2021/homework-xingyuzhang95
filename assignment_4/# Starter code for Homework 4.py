# Starter Code:
# Start making your changes here. 

#NOTE: You will be working with the numpy array 'flow_data'
# Flow data has a row for every day and 4 columns:
# 1. Year
# 2. Month
# 3. Day of the month
# 4. Flow value in CFS

# _______________
# Example 1: counting the number of values with flow > 600 and month ==7
# Note we are doing this by asking for the rows where the flow column (i.e. Flow_data[:,3]) is >600
# And where the month column (i.e. flow_data[:,1]) is equal to 7

# 1a. Here is how to do that on one line of code
flow_count = np.sum((flow_data[:,3] < 75) & (flow_data[:,1]==9))
flow_sep   = np.sum(flow_data[:,1] == 9)
print(flow_count)
print(flow_count/flow_sep)

# -----------------question 4-----------------
flow_count1 = np.sum((flow_data[:,3] < 75) & (flow_data[:,1]==9) & (flow_data[:,0] < 2000))
flow_count2 = np.sum((flow_data[:,3] < 75) & (flow_data[:,1]==9) & (flow_data[:,0] > 2010))
flow_sep1   = np.sum((flow_data[:,1] == 9) & (flow_data[:,0] < 2000))
flow_sep2   = np.sum((flow_data[:,1] == 9)  & (flow_data[:,0] > 2010))
print(flow_count1)
print(flow_count2)
print(flow_count1/flow_sep1)
print(flow_count2/flow_sep2)

# Here is the same thing broken out into multiple lines:
flow_test = flow_data[:, 3] < 100  # Note that this returns a 1-d array that has an entry for every day of the timeseies (i.e. row) with either a true or a fals
month_test = flow_data[:, 1] ==9   # doing the same thing but testing if month =7 
combined_test = flow_test & month_test  # now looking at our last two tests and finding when they are both true
flow_count = np.sum(combined_test) # add up all the array (note Trues = 1 and False =0) so by default this counts all the times our criteria are true
print(flow_count)

#__________________________
## Example 2: Calculate the average flow for these same criteria 
# 2.a How to do it with one line of code: 
# Note this is exactly like the line above exexpt now we are grabbing out the flow data
# and then taking the averge
flow_mean1 = np.mean(flow_data[(flow_data[:,2] <= 15) & (flow_data[:,1]==9),3])
flow_mean2 = np.mean(flow_data[(flow_data[:,2] >  15) & (flow_data[:,1]==9),3])
print("flow during first half Sep is " , flow_mean1)
print("flow during second half Sep is ", flow_mean2)

# 2.b The same thing split out into multiple steps
criteria = (flow_data[:, 3] < 100) & (flow_data[:, 1] == 9)  # This returns an array of true fals values with an entrry for every day, telling us where our criteria are met
flow_pick = flow_data[criteria, 3] #Grab out the 4th column (i.e. flow) for every row wherer the criteria was true
flow_mean =  np.mean(flow_pick) # take the average of the values you extracted

print("Flow meets this critera", flow_count, " times")
print('And has an average value of', np.round(flow_mean,2), "when this is true")

#__________________________
## Example 3: Make a histogram of data

# step 1: Use the linspace  funciton to create a set  of evenly spaced bins
#mybins = np.linspace(0, 1000, num=100)
# another example using the max flow to set the upper limit for the bins
flow_pick2 = flow_data[(flow_data[:,2] > 15) & (flow_data[:,1] ==9),3]
print(np.max(flow_pick2))
print(np.min(flow_pick2))
print(np.mean(flow_pick2))

mybins = np.linspace(0, 600, num=2000) 
#Step 2: plotting the histogram
plt.hist(flow_data[(flow_data[:,2] > 15) & (flow_data[:,1] ==9 ),3], bins = mybins)
plt.title('Streamflow')
plt.xlabel('Flow [cfs]')
plt.ylabel('Count')

#__________________________
## Example 4: Get the quantiles of flow

# 4.a  Apply the np.quantile function to the flow column 
# grab out the 10th, 50th and 90th percentile flow values
flow_quants1 = np.quantile(flow_pick2, q=[0,0.1, 0.5, 0.9])
print('Method one flow quantiles:', flow_quants1)

# 4.b  use the axis=0 argument to indicate that you would like the funciton 
# applied along columns. In this case you will get quantlies for every column of the 
# data automatically 
flow_quants2 = np.quantile(flow_data, q=[0,0.1, 0.5, 0.9], axis=0)
#note flow_quants2 has 4 columns just like our data so we need to say flow_quants2[:,3]
# to extract the flow quantiles for our flow data. 
print('Method two flow quantiles:', flow_quants2[:,3]) 
# %%
